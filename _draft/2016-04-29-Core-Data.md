## Introduction

### Core Data

an object graph management and persistence framework in the OS X and iOS SDKs

* it is not a relational database
* it can SQQLite as the data store behind the scenes

#### Object Graph Management

Core Data works with objects that you define

* Cocoa : an object-oriented framework
* Core Data builds on this to keep track of the objects and their relationships to each other

#### Persistence 

the data is stored somewhere durable

* lazily loading objects
* caching to optimize both memory usage and speed

#### Many other Features

- custom filtering
- sort the data
- synchronize a data store with iCloud

## Your First Core Data App

* model data using Xcode's model editor
* add new records to Core Data
* fetch a set of records form Core Data
* display the fetched results in a table view

### Getting Started

#### Core Data Stack

* boilerplate code
* consists a set of objects that facilitate saving and retrieving information from CoreData
* can customize the stack to be more efficient

#### TalbeView's DataSource

* make the view controller the table view's data source
* ViewController - manually, TableViewController - autumatically

#### Set up the Model

* a mutable Array

#### registerClass

* register the class : ?
* it will reurn a correct type

#### UITableViewDataSource protocol

* the class conform to the protocol should implement the data source methods
* tableView(tableView: numberOfRowsInSection:) : how many rows
* tableView(tableView: cellForRowAtIndexPath:) : dequeues table view cells and pupulates them with the data

#### UIAlertViewController

* custom a UIAlertViewController

#### reloadData()

### Modeling your data

#### Persistence

* plain Swift Strings : store the data in memory
* Core Data : represents data on disk

- to create a **managed object model**
- by default, Core Data uses an SQLite database as the persistent store
- think of the data model as the database schema

> `Managed` : refers to Core Data's management of the life cycle of Core Data Objects - `NSManagedObjectContext`
> a comprehensive list of Core Data classes : **<CoreData/CoreData.h>**

* use Core Data : Xcode automatically created a data model file - *****.xcdatamodel**
	* a powerful data model editor : a lot of features
	
* Core Data terms : its own vocabulary
	* **entity** : a class definition in Core Data - a table (in a relational database)
	* **attribute** : a piece of information attached to a particular - a particular field in a table
	* **relationship** : a link between multiple entities 
		* **to-one relationships** : between two entities
		* **to-many relationship** : between one and many entites

> the difference between entity and class
> 
> a Core Data entity : as a clas **definition**
> 
> the managed object : as an instance of that class

### Saving to Core Data

#### Import the Core Data

* import the Core Data module : a simple `import` statement is all you need to start using Core Data APIs
* replace the table view's model : `NSManagedObject` 
	* represents a single object stored in Core Data
	* a shape-shifter : can take the form of any entity in data model
* replace both data source methods 

> KVC (key-value coding)
> 
> 	* a mechanism in Cocoa and Cocoa Touch for accessing an objec's properties indirectly 
> 	* available to all clsses that descend from `NSObject`, including `NSManagedObject`

#### Save or Retrieve anything from Core Data Store

* get on an `NSManagedObjectContext` : an in-memory *scratchpad* for working with managed objects
- saving a new managed object to Core Data : two-step process
	- insert a new managed object into a managed object context
	- `commit` the changes in managed object context to save it to disk
* Xcode : a managed object context as part of the new project's template - only if you check the **Use Core Data** 
* default managed object context : as a property of the application delegate - to access it : get a reference to the app delegate

- create a new managed object and insert it into the managed object context : `NSManagedObject`'s designated initializer - `init(entity:insertIntoManagedObjectContext:)`
	- `NSEntityDescription` : the peice that links the entity definition from your data model with an instance of `NSManagedObject` at runtime
	
#### Migration Issues

* lightweight migration : [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8881453/the-model-used-to-open-the-store-is-incompatible-with-the-one-used-to-create-the), [RayWenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/114084/core-data-migrations-tutorial-lightweight-migrations)

### Fetching from Core Data

#### Fetch

* **fetch** : to get data from your persistent store and into the managed object context
