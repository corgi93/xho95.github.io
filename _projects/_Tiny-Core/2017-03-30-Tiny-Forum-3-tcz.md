Thank you for your reply.

But as you know, I can't use the syslinux, should use the pxelinux.

And anyway if I will make my own core.gz, it should be compressed by cpio and it will be crushed as like before.

Therefore I want to know the method that use the original core.gz with my tcz program file - my own extension(?). And my tcz program should start immediately after the boot time.

Could you explain the processs for it or tell me a link of some useful data?

Thank you.
