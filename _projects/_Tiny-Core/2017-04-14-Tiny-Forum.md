First I have install Tiny Core Linux on the VirtualBox of the Ubuntu 16.04.

Then, I have set the develop environment for Tiny Core Linux with command as shown below. 

```
$ tce-load -wi compiletc 
```

And I made some simple programs with C and C++.

However, Tiny Core linux on the VirtualBox was broken after some sleep mode. Error code is like as below.

After that I can't excute the Tiny Core linux. I have found some data with Google search, but those are not helpful. 

Can I fix it?
